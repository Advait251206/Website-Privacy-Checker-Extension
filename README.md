# Website-Privacy-Checker-Extension
I developed this extension for the HacKronyX hackathon organized by St. Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering and Technology (SVPCET), Nagpur. It checks website privacy and gives a score out of 100, helping users quickly assess how trustworthy a site is without overwhelming them.
